# ggjgc_snow.py

This is a snow effect. Snow particles are spawned in the top third of the tree and randomly pick LEDs below them to move to.

It creates an effect like brownian motion because the LEDs are randomly placed.

Requires matts_tree_helpers.py from https://github.com/gentlegiantJGC/xmastree2021-simulator
