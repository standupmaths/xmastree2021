# 2020 Examples

These examples were taken from the [standupmaths/xmastree2020](https://github.com/standupmaths/xmastree2020) repository.

The python scripts from 2020 were processed using [santiagodg/xmastree-2020py-to-2021csv](https://github.com/santiagodg/xmastree-2020py-to-2021csv) to generate 2021's animation CSV files and sometimes manually modifying them to make them work.

These CSVs have not been verified by the original animators.
